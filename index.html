        Fold this cute monster with nice color changes and fun
         folding sequence. The design avoids difficult steps 
         (there are no closed sinks) and tedious pre-creasing 
         (there are no grids or grafts). This tribute to Godzilla
          can be folded in many different kinds of papers and is 
          suitable for almost any size.</p>

   <p>This model was first designed in 2014, but this is an updated
        version with some “bug fixes” (legs are properly locked) 
        and a color changed horn.
        The biggest flaw of the old version is that the legs and layers
         of the body would spread open after a while. This could be solved 
         using foil paper or the wet folding technique.So, to solve this problem,
          he’ve made some locks on the legs and  rearranged some layers on 
          the crimp fold of the neck and added some locks inside the body too.</p>
